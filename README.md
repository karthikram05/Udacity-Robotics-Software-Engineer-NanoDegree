#### Shell Scripts
A shell script is a file containing a series of commands and could be executed. It is commonly used to set up environment, run a program
After the shell script file is created to launch one or many nodes each in separate terminals, we will have the power to track the output of different nodes and keep the convenience of running a single command to launch all nodes.
